Q.5SCORING DOCUMENTATION
üìò Scoring System Explanation
Document Types
Known Documents: Publicly available
Unknown Documents: Private & unseen
Document-Level Weightage
Known Documents: Low weightage (e.g., 0.5)
Unknown Documents: High weightage (e.g., 2.0)
Question-Level Weightage
Each question may have its own weight (e.g., some are worth more due to complexity or importance).
Score Calculation
For each correct answer:
Score = Question Weight √ó Document Weight
Final score is the sum of all such scores across all documents.
üìä Example

Documents:
Doc A (Known) ‚Äì Weight: 0.5
Doc B (Unknown) ‚Äì Weight: 2.0
Questions:
Question	Document	Answered Correctly?	Question Weight	Score Contribution
Q1	Doc A	‚úÖ Yes	1.0	1.0 √ó 0.5 = 0.5
Q2	Doc A	‚ùå No	2.0	0
Q3	Doc B	‚úÖ Yes	1.0	1.0 √ó 2.0 = 2.0
Q4	Doc B	‚úÖ Yes	2.0	2.0 √ó 2.0 = 4.0
üßÆ Total Score:
Doc A Contribution: 0.5
Doc B Contribution: 2.0 + 4.0 = 6.0
Final Score = 0.5 + 6.0 = 6.5
‚úÖ Key Points

Correct answers from unknown documents contribute more.
High-weight questions boost your score significantly.
Incorrect or unattempted questions contribute 0, regardless of weight.
Note: This is just an indicative method of scoring. The actual scoring system may vary based on final evaluation criteria.
